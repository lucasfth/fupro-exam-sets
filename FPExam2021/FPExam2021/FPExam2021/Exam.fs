(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertantly
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

let path2 _ = failwith "not implemented"

(* Question 1.6 *)

(* Q: Your solution for `path` is not tail recursive. Why? To make a compelling
      argument you should evaluate a function call of the function, similarly to
      what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation.
      You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the
      function is not tail recursive. Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation
      chain must evaluate to the same value
      (```(5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27```, for instance).

    Q: What are the types of functions foo, bar, and baz?

    A: <Your answer goes here>


    Q: What do functions foo and baz do (skip bar)?
       Focus on what they do rather than how they do it.

    A: <Your answer goes here>

    The function foo uses a mutable variable.

    Q: What function does it serve (why is it there)?

    A: <Your answer goes here>

    Q: What would happen if you removed the mutable keyword from the line
       let mutable m = Map.empty? Would the function foo still work?
       If yes, why; if no, why not?

    A: <Your answer goes here>

    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo, bar, and baz?

(* Question 2.2 *)


(* 
    The code includes the keyword "and".

    
    Q: What function does this keyword serve in general
       (why would you use "and" when writing any program)?

    A: <Your answer goes here>


    Q: What would happen if you removed it from this particular program and
       replaced it with a standard "let"
       (change the line "and baz = foo bar" to "let baz = foo bar")?

    A: <Your answer goes here>

    *)

(* Question 2.3 *)

(* 
    The function foo generates a warning during compilation:
    "Warning: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression.".

    Q: Why does this happen, and where? 

    A: <Your answer goes here>


    Q: For these particular three functions will this incomplete pattern match
       ever cause problems for any possible execution of baz? If yes, why;
       if no, why not.

    A: <Your answer goes here>

    Q: The function foo has two redundant computations and is hence not as
       efficient as it could be. What are these two computations and why
       are they redundant?

(*

    Q: Without explicitly timing the execution times, compare the execution
       times of baz and barbaz. One is slower than the other.
       Why? You do not have to give exact times, just spot which one is
       slower and explain why.
