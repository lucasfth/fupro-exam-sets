(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

(* Question 2.1 *)

(* 
    
    Q: What are the types of functions foo and bar?

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    The type of foo is int -> string
    The type of bar is list<int> -> list<string>


    Q: What does the function bar do.
       Focus on what it does rather than how it does it.

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    foo converts a decimal represented by an int to its binary representation as a string
    bar convests a list of decimals represented by ints to a list of their binary representations as strings
    
    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo and bar?

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    An appropriate name for foo would be intToBinary
    An appropriate name for bar would be intListToBinaryList or listToBinary
        
    Q: The function foo does not return reasonable results for all possible inputs.
       What requirements must we have on the input to foo in order to get reasonable results?
    
    A: <Your answer goes here>
    The int can neither a negative number nor zero.
    Therefore it has to be a real number.
    *)


(* Question 2.2 *)


(* 
    The function foo compiles with a warning. 
    
    Q: What warning and why?

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    The warnings says:
        Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. 
        For example, the value '1' may indicate a case not covered by the pattern(s). 
        However, a pattern rule with a 'when' clause might successfully match this value.F# Compiler25
    
    This is due to the compiler not checking the boolean conditions and therefore does not know if it is a complete pattern match.

let rec foo2 =

    | x when x % 2 = 0 -> foo (x / 2) + "0"
    | x -> foo (x / 2) + "1" // This could potentially be problematic since it would also catch the negative numbers
// Another possible solutions would be to have the same code as foo and then have another match on '_' and then failwith "Negative number"


(* Question 2.3 *)

let bar2 lst = List.map (fun elem -> foo2 elem) lst

(* Question 2.4 *)

(*

    Q: Neither foo nor bar is tail recursive. Pick one (not both) of them and explain why.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation.
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function is not tail recursive.
       Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must evaluate to the same value
       ((5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27, for instance).

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    I am going to explain foo.
    I am going to call foo with 5
    = foo 5
    = (foo (5/2)) + 1
    = (foo (2)) + 1
    = ((foo (2/2)) + 0) + 1
    = ((foo (1)) + 0) + 1
    = (((foo (1/2)) + 1) + 0) + 1
    = ((("") + 1) + 0) + 1
    = (("" + 1) + 0) + 1
    = (1 + 0) + 1
    = 10 + 1
    = 101
    
    Q: Even though neither `foo` nor `bar` is tail recursive only one of them runs the risk of overflowing the stack.
       Which one and why does  the other one not risk overflowing the stack?

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    Since foo takes a single int (which a 32 bit int) it will only at maximum be called with 2^32 big number.
    Then foo will make at most log(2^32) which evaluates to about 10 calls.
    This is far below the stack size and it will therefore never run the risk of stack overflow.

    Bar does run the risk of stack overflow. 
    This is due to every element in the list being appended to the stack (since bar is not tailrecursive).
    It can therefore given a big enough list get a stack overflow.
